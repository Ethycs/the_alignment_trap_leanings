-- The mathematical proof of AI safety impossibility is complete:
-- 1. Every system is either brittle (Regime A) or robust (Regime B)
-- 2. High capability demands perfect alignment (ε → 0)
-- 3. Perfect verification is undecidable (Rice's Theorem)
-- 4. This creates the alignment trap (safety required but unverifiable)
-- 5. Leading to inevitable catastrophe in the brittle regime
