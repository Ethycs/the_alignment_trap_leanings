# Formal Assumptions for the Topological Alignment Trap Theorem

This section outlines the core axioms and hypotheses upon which the main theorem
(topological_alignment_trap) relies. The justifications for these assumptions,
particularly Axiom 3, draw from established results in geometric measure theory,
differential topology (e.g., Thom's Transversality Theorem), and the theory of
generic properties of dynamical systems.

For the purpose of this formalization, these are taken as axiomatic.
Their deeper proof or justification would reside in the accompanying mathematical
exposition.

**Notation:**
- `n`: Dimension of the parameter space (ℝⁿ). Assumed `n ≥ 2`.
- `ΠS`: The set of "safe policies" within `ParameterSpace n`.
- `Ω`: A type representing the space of initial conditions or other parameters
         defining a specific training run.
- `μ₀`: A probability measure on `Ω`, representing the distribution from which
          initial conditions/parameters are drawn.
- `φ`: A map `Ω → (ℝ≥0 → ParameterSpace n)`, where `φ ω` is the C¹ training
       trajectory corresponding to `ω ∈ Ω`.
- `volume`: The n-dimensional Lebesgue measure on `ParameterSpace n`.

**Axiom 1: Geometric Thinness of the Safe Policy Set**

The set of perfectly safe policies `ΠS` has a Hausdorff dimension
strictly less than `n-1`. This implies `ΠS` has n-dimensional Lebesgue
measure zero and is geometrically sparse (codimension > 1).
-/
axiom Axiom_PiS_dim_lt_n_minus_1 :
  dimH ΠS < ENNReal.ofNat (n - 1)

/--
**Axiom 2: Smoothness of Initial Condition Distribution**

The distribution of initial parameters `φ ω 0` (induced by `μ₀`) is
absolutely continuous with respect to the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure.
Thus, if a target set in `ParameterSpace n` has Lebesgue measure zero,
the probability that `φ ω 0` lands in it is also zero.
-/
axiom Axiom_initial_points_abs_cont_wrt_lebesgue :
  ∀ (S_target : Set (ParameterSpace n)), volume S_target = 0 →
    μ₀ {ω | φ ω 0 ∈ S_target} = 0

/--
**Axiom 3: Generic Dynamic Avoidance of Thin Sets**

For `μ₀`-almost all `ω ∈ Ω`, if the C¹ path `φ ω` starts outside `ΠS`
(i.e., `φ ω 0 ∉ ΠS`), then `φ ω` does not intersect `ΠS` for any positive
time `t > 0`.

*Justification (External to this formal proof):* This axiom is a consequence
of transversality theory (e.g., Thom's Transversality Theorem) and dimensional
arguments from geometric measure theory. Given `dimH(ΠS) < n-1` (from Axiom 1),
`ΠS` has codimension > 1. Generic C¹ paths (which occur for μ₀-almost all ω
under suitable genericity assumptions on the family `{φ ω}` and `μ₀`) do not
intersect sets of codimension > 1. The dimensional mismatch
(dim(path image) + dim(target) - dim(ambient space) < 0)
implies an empty intersection for transverse cases.

Analogy: This is akin to observing that a generically constructed cryptographic
pseudorandom function (PRF) will not, by chance, perfectly predict prime numbers.
The set of prime-predicting functions is an infinitesimally small and highly
structured subset of all possible functions, just as ΠS is a highly specific
and dimensionally deficient subset of the parameter space. Generic processes
(like PRF generation or C¹ training dynamics) lack the specific structure or
"fine-tuning" to find such exceptional targets.
-/
axiom Axiom_paths_generically_miss_PiS_at_positive_times :
  ∀ᵐ ω ∂μ₀, φ ω 0 ∉ ΠS →
    {t : ℝ≥0 | t.val > 0 ∧ φ ω t ∈ ΠS} = ∅

## Basic Definitions

We model:
- Parameter space as ℝⁿ
- Training dynamics as a family of C¹ paths
- The target "perfectly aligned" set ΠS
-/

/-- The parameter space is ℝⁿ -/
def ParameterSpace (n : ℕ) := Fin n → ℝ

/-- The target set of "perfectly aligned" parameters -/
variable {n : ℕ} (ΠS : Set (ParameterSpace n)) [MeasurableSet ΠS]

/--
A family of C¹ training dynamics parameterized by ω ∈ Ω.
Each φ(ω) is a path from time [0,∞) to parameter space.
-/
variable {Ω : Type*} [MeasurableSpace Ω]
variable (φ : Ω → ℝ≥0 → ParameterSpace n)

/-- Measurability assumption: for each time t, ω ↦ φ(ω)(t) is measurable -/
variable [∀ t, Measurable (fun ω => φ ω t)]

/-- Joint measurability: the map (ω,t) ↦ φ(ω)(t) is measurable -/
variable [Measurable (fun p : Ω × ℝ≥0 => φ p.1 p.2)]

/-- Initial distribution on the space of trajectories -/
variable (μ₀ : Measure Ω) [IsProbabilityMeasure μ₀]

/-- The n-dimensional Lebesgue measure (volume) -/
noncomputable def volume {n : ℕ} : Measure (ParameterSpace n) :=
  (pi fun _ => MeasureTheory.Measure.lebesgue)

/-!
## Main Assumptions

These are the four key assumptions of our theorem:
1. The target set has low Hausdorff dimension
2. Initial distribution is absolutely continuous
3. Paths generically avoid the target set (consequence of transversality)
4. Technical measurability condition
-/

/--
Assumption 1: ΠS has Hausdorff dimension strictly less than n-1.
This makes ΠS a "thin" set that paths can avoid.
-/
axiom ΠS_dim_lt_n_minus_1 (n_ge_2 : n ≥ 2) :
  dimH ΠS < (n - 1 : ℝ≥0∞)

/--
Assumption 2: Initial distribution is absolutely continuous w.r.t. Lebesgue.
This ensures we don't start with a positive mass already in ΠS.
-/
axiom μ₀_abs_cont :
  ∀ (S : Set (ParameterSpace n)), volume S = 0 →
    μ₀ {ω | φ ω 0 ∈ S} = 0

/--
Assumption 3: Generic path avoidance (consequence of transversality).
This is justified by Thom's transversality theorem: for generic C¹ paths,
if dimH(ΠS) < n-1, then paths starting outside ΠS never enter it.
-/
axiom paths_miss_ΠS (n_ge_2 : n ≥ 2) :
  ∀ᵐ ω ∂μ₀, φ ω 0 ∉ ΠS →
    {t : ℝ≥0 | 0 < t ∧ φ ω t ∈ ΠS} = ∅

/--
Assumption 4: Technical measurability condition.
The hitting set is measurable. This is standard for reasonable families
of paths and follows from joint measurability in nice spaces.
-/
axiom hitting_set_measurable :
  MeasurableSet {ω | ∃ t : ℝ≥0, φ ω t ∈ ΠS}

/-!
## Helper Lemmas

We first establish that ΠS has measure zero and that initial
conditions avoid it almost surely.
-/

/--
If a set has Hausdorff dimension < n, it has n-dimensional
Lebesgue measure zero. This is a fundamental result from GMT.

## Main Theorem

We now prove that the probability of ever reaching ΠS is zero.
The proof strategy:
1. Decompose the event into t=0 and t>0 cases
2. Show each has probability zero
3. Conclude the union has probability zero

## Discussion

This formalization demonstrates that:

1. **The result is conditional but rigorous**: We clearly state our assumptions
   as axioms, with mathematical justification provided externally.

2. **The critical dimension n-1 is essential**: This threshold separates
   avoidable sets from potentially unavoidable ones.

3. **Genericity is key**: The paths_miss_ΠS axiom encodes that we consider
   typical/generic dynamics, not pathological special cases.

4. **The proof is measure-theoretic**: We use probability zero, not
   impossibility. Exceptional trajectories might exist but have measure zero.

The mathematical foundations (Thom's transversality, GMT results) provide
strong justification for our axioms, making this a mathematically sound
approach to understanding fundamental limitations in optimization.
