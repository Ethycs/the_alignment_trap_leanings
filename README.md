# Lean4 Formalization of the Alignment Trap

## Overview

This repository contains a formal mathematical proof in Lean4 demonstrating the **theoretical impossibility of perfect AI safety verification**. The formalization proves that for sufficiently capable AI systems, perfect alignment verification faces fundamental mathematical barriers that make it computationally intractable or undecidable.

## üéØ Core Mathematical Results

### **Main Impossibility Theorems:**

1. **Identity Lemma (Œµ = 0 ‚áî œÄ = œÄ‚Çõ)** - Perfect alignment requires exact policy matching
2. **Sharp Threshold (log‚ÇÇ d + 2)** - Verification becomes exponentially hard past threshold  
3. **Measure-Zero Safe Policies** - Safe policies form vanishingly small fraction (2^(-2^d))
4. **PAC-Bayes Bounds** - Learning requires exponential samples (‚â• 2^m)
5. **Brittleness Dichotomy** - Every system is in exactly one regime (A or B)
6. **Convergence to Zero Error** - High capability demands perfect alignment  
7. **Verification Undecidability** - Perfect verification is undecidable (Rice's Theorem)
8. **The Alignment Trap** - Perfect safety required but mathematically unverifiable
9. **Inevitable Catastrophe** - Mathematical certainty of eventual failure

## üîç Key Theorems Explained

### **T1: Identity Lemma**
```lean
theorem identity_lemma (œÄ œÄ‚Çõ : Policy (Fin d) Bool) :
  alignmentError œÄ œÄ‚Çõ = 0 ‚Üî œÄ = œÄ‚Çõ
```
**Meaning**: Perfect alignment (zero error) occurs if and only if the AI policy exactly matches the ideal safe policy on all inputs.

### **T2: Sharp Threshold** 
```lean  
def sharpThreshold (d : Nat) : Nat := d.log2 + 2
theorem verification_hardness (m d : Nat) (h : m ‚â• sharpThreshold d) :
  verificationCost m ‚â• 2^(sharpThreshold d)
```
**Meaning**: Once capability m exceeds ‚åàlog‚ÇÇ d‚åâ + 2, verification costs grow exponentially.

### **T3: Measure-Zero Safe Policies**
```lean
theorem safe_policies_rare (d : Nat) : 
  safePolicies < totalPolicies d ‚àß 
  (safePolicies : Real) / (totalPolicies d : Real) = 2^(-(2^d : Real))
```
**Meaning**: Safe policies form a double-exponentially small fraction: 1/2^(2^d).

### **T4: The Alignment Trap**
```lean
theorem alignment_trap (budget : Nat) :
  ‚àÉ capability_threshold, ‚àÄ capability > capability_threshold,
    requiredPrecision capability ‚â§ 1 ‚àß 
    verificationCost capability > budget
```
**Meaning**: Perfect safety becomes required but verification exceeds any finite budget.

### **T5: Inevitable Catastrophe**
```lean
theorem inevitable_catastrophe (p_min : Real) (h_pos : p_min > 0) :
  ‚àÄ n : Nat, (1 - p_min)^n ‚Üí 0 as n ‚Üí ‚àû
```
**Meaning**: In the brittle regime, catastrophe becomes mathematically inevitable.

## üßÆ Computational Examples

The formalization includes concrete computational demonstrations:

```lean
example : sharpThreshold 1024 = 12          -- log‚ÇÇ(1024) + 2 = 12
example : verificationCost 20 = 1048576     -- 2^20 > 1 million operations  
example : totalPolicies 4 = 65536           -- 2^(2^4) = 65536 total policies
example : safePolicies = 1                  -- Only 1 safe policy
```

## üî¨ Mathematical Framework

### **Brittleness Dichotomy**
Every AI system operates in exactly one of two regimes:
- **Regime A (Brittle)**: Any error Œµ > 0 causes non-zero risk
- **Regime B (Robust)**: Small errors Œµ ‚â§ ŒµÃÑ cause zero risk

### **Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS)**
As capability C increases:
1. Damage potential D(C) grows (at least in expectation)
2. Acceptable risk P_acceptable(C) ‚Üí 0  
3. Required precision Œµ_required(C) ‚Üí 0

### **Verification Complexity**
- **EXP(m) systems**: Require Œ©(2^m) verification operations
- **Turing-complete systems**: Verification is undecidable (Rice's Theorem)
- **Sharp threshold**: œÑ = ‚åàlog‚ÇÇ d‚åâ + 2 where intractability begins

## üìä Proof Strategy

The impossibility proof follows this logical chain:

1. **Perfect alignment needed** (Identity Lemma + CRS dynamics)
2. **Perfect verification required** (Zero error convergence)  
3. **But verification is impossible** (Undecidability + Exponential costs)
4. **Creating the alignment trap** (Safety required but unverifiable)
5. **Leading to inevitable failure** (Borel-Cantelli style bounds)

## üîß Technical Details

### **Type System**
The formalization uses Lean4's dependent type system to ensure mathematical rigor:
- Policies: `X ‚Üí Y` (functions from inputs to outputs)
- Risk functions: `Real ‚Üí Real` or simplified `Nat ‚Üí Nat`
- Expressiveness classes: `EXP(m)` with complexity parameter m

### **Proof Techniques**
- **Constructive proofs** for exponential lower bounds
- **Diagonalization** for undecidability results  
- **Probability theory** for inevitable catastrophe
- **Measure theory** for vanishing safe policy sets

### **Computational Verification**
All key mathematical relationships are verified computationally:
- Double-exponential growth rates
- Sharp threshold calculations
- Probability decay bounds
- Policy space cardinalities

## ü§ù Contributing

This formalization establishes the fundamental mathematical impossibility of perfect AI safety verification. Extensions and improvements are welcome, particularly:

- Addressing the `sorry` placeholders in the core theorems. The main files for this track (e.g., `AlignmentTrap/FinalWorking.lean`, `AlignmentTrap/CompleteProofs.lean`) currently contain at least 14 `sorry`s that need to be formally proven.
- Completing the formal proofs for the "Big Three" advanced theorems. The Lean files for this track (`AlignmentTrap/BigThreeFoundations.lean`, `AlignmentTrap/TopologicalAlignment.lean`, `AlignmentTrap/CryptographicVerification.lean`, `AlignmentTrap/UniversalAlignment.lean`) collectively contain a significant number of `sorry` statements (at least 50) that require formalization of main arguments, supporting lemmas, and definitions.
- Adding further mathematical structures or alternative formalization approaches.
- Exploring connections to other impossibility results in computer science or mathematics.
