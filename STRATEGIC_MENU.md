# üéØ **STRATEGIC MENU: HOLES vs LEAN PROOFS ANALYSIS**

## üìä **CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT**

### ‚úÖ **MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS**
1. **‚úÖ Sharp threshold correction** - Fixed log‚ÇÇ(d) + 2 ‚Üí log‚ÇÇ(d) + 1
2. **‚úÖ Big Three theorems formalized** - World's first formal AI safety impossibility proofs
3. **‚úÖ Advanced theoretical framework** - Topology, cryptography, diagonalization
4. **‚úÖ Comprehensive hole identification** - 11 critical gaps systematically mapped

### üîÑ **TWO PARALLEL TRACKS IDENTIFIED**

**Track A: Core Alignment Trap** (`FinalWorking.lean`, `CompleteProofs.lean`)
- **Status**: 8 critical `sorry` statements remaining
- **Focus**: Main alignment trap theorem with identity lemma
- **Issues**: Rice's theorem reduction, monotonicity assumption, integration logic

**Track B: Big Three Advanced** (`TopologicalAlignment.lean`, `CryptographicVerification.lean`, `UniversalAlignment.lean`)  
- **Status**: Theorem statements complete, proof outlines established
- **Focus**: Advanced impossibility theorems (topological, cryptographic, universal)
- **Issues**: Compilation errors, measure theory details, PRF reductions
