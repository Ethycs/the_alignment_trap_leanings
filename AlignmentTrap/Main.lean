# The Alignment Trap: Complete Formalization

This file integrates all components of the Alignment Trap formalization,
providing the main theorems that demonstrate the fundamental impossibility
of achieving perfect AI safety verification beyond the sharp threshold.

This corresponds to the complete mathematical framework from the paper
"The Alignment Trap: Perfect AI Safety is Impossible" and its appendix.
