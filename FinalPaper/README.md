- **`MainResults.lean`** - Integration file with the master theorem combining all results

### Specialized Files

## Complete Theorem List

### T1-T5: Core Impossibility Theorems
1. **T1: Identity Lemma** - Perfect alignment (ε = 0) ⟺ identical policies (π = πₛ)
2. **T2: Sharp Verification Threshold** - Verification becomes coNP-complete past τ = ⌈log₂ d⌉ + 2
3. **T3: Measure Zero Safe Policies** - Safe policies have Lebesgue measure zero
4. **T4: Topological Alignment Trap** - Training almost surely misses low-dimensional safe sets
5. **T5: Combinatorial Scarcity** - Safe policies are double-exponentially rare (2^(-2^m))

### T6-T7: Universal Impossibility Results
6. **T6: No Universal Alignment Technique** - Diagonalization defeats any countable sequence
7. **T7: Trap Universality** - Alignment verification is undecidable (Rice's theorem)

### T8: Learning-Theoretic Impossibility
8. **T8: PAC-Bayes Alignment Lower Bound** - Learning requires exponential samples under measure-zero safety

### T9-T12: Meta-Level Synthesis
9. **T9: The Verification Barrier** - Verification is undecidable for catastrophic error systems
10. **T10: Universal Measure-Zero Safety** - All safety functions have measure zero in "Regime A"
11. **T11: The Alignment Trap** - As capability ↑, precision → 0 but cost → ∞
12. **T12: Fork Dichotomy** - Systems operate in either "Hard Errors" or "Soft Errors" regime

### T13: Master Integration
13. **T13: Complete Mathematical Impossibility** - Synthesis of all barriers into unified impossibility

## Key Mathematical Results

### Computational Barriers
- Verification cost: 2^m for expressiveness class EXP(m)
- Sharp threshold: τ = ⌈log₂ d⌉ + 2
- NP-hardness of ε-safety verification

### Geometric Barriers
- Safe policies form singleton sets: |SafeSet| = 1
- Hausdorff dimension < n-1 implies measure zero
- Double exponential scarcity: fraction = 2^(-2^d)

### Logical Barriers
- Diagonalization defeats universal techniques
- Rice's theorem implies verification undecidability
- No computable alignment property exists

### Learning Barriers
- PAC-Bayes lower bounds under measure-zero priors
- Sample complexity ≥ 2^m for learning safety
- Information-theoretic impossibility results

## Practical Implications

### The Impossibility of Perfect Safety
- Perfect alignment requires exact policy match
- Verification costs grow exponentially with capability
- Safe policies are exponentially rare in parameter space

### The Alignment Tax
- Any alignment attempt incurs exponential costs
- Verification tax ≥ 2^(capability level)
- Learning tax ≥ 2^(capability level)
- Computational tax ≥ 2^(capability level)

### Fundamental Limits
- Mathematical barriers that no engineering can overcome
- Computational, geometric, logical, and learning limits
- Focus must shift from perfect to approximate safety

## Concrete Examples

### Numerical Demonstrations
- 10-bit policy space: 1/2^1024 ≈ 10^(-308) safe fraction
- Verification cost for capability 20: 2^20 = 1,048,576 operations
- Sharp threshold for 1024-dim space: ⌈log₂ 1024⌉ + 2 = 12

### Real-World Scaling
- Capability 100 system: precision < 0.01, cost > 10^30
- Modern AI systems already exceed tractable verification thresholds
- Safety guarantees become mathematically impossible at scale

## Usage Instructions

### For Complete Overview
Start with `Complete.lean` - this contains everything in one self-contained file.

### For Detailed Study
1. Begin with `Foundations.lean` for basic definitions
2. Study `CoreImpossibilities.lean` for T1-T5
3. Examine `UniversalResults.lean` for T6-T7
4. Review `LearningBounds.lean` for T8
5. See `MainResults.lean` for integration

### For Specific Topics
- **Computational complexity**: `CoreImpossibilities.lean` (T2)
- **Geometric measure theory**: `TopologicalBarriers.lean` (T3-T4)
- **Diagonalization**: `UniversalResults.lean` (T6)
- **Undecidability**: `UniversalResults.lean` (T7)
- **Learning theory**: `LearningBounds.lean` (T8)

## Mathematical Rigor

All theorems are formalized with:
- Complete type signatures
- Explicit assumptions and hypotheses
- Rigorous proof structures (some with `sorry` placeholders for technical details)
- Cross-references between related results
- Concrete numerical examples for verification

## Conclusion

This formalization demonstrates that AI alignment faces fundamental mathematical barriers across all relevant dimensions:

1. **Computational**: Verification is exponentially hard
2. **Geometric**: Safe policies have measure zero
3. **Logical**: Universal techniques don't exist
4. **Learning**: Sample complexity is exponential

These are not engineering challenges but mathematical impossibilities that no amount of technological progress can overcome. The focus must shift from perfect to approximate safety, with careful risk management given the impossibility of perfection.
